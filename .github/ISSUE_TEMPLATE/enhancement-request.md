<!--
Please make sure that your request is in-scope for this repo.

This project has a strictly limited scope: compiling Scala to JS, and interoperate with the ECMAScript language. Anything else is out of scope.

Typical things that are out of scope include:

* Can it be implemented as a library or as an external tool? If yes, it is out of scope.
  Existing examples:
    * https://github.com/scala/scala-async for async/await
    * https://github.com/scalacenter/scalajs-bundler for integration with npm/yarn
    * https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-env-jsdom-nodejs for execution under jsdom
* Is it a missing Java library? If yes, check whether there is a separate library that provides it (e.g., `java.time`): https://www.scala-js.org/libraries/libs.html.
* Is it a missing JavaScript library? Unless it is specified in ECMAScript itself, it is out of scope.
  Check out https://www.scala-js.org/libraries/facades.html and https://github.com/oyvindberg/ScalablyTyped
* Is it a language feature request? Unless it addresses something of ECMAScript that cannot be done in Scala.js yet, or would have a huge overhead if done separately, it is out of scope.
  Ask on Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scala.js) or Gitter (https://gitter.im/scala-js/scala-js) how best to do what you're trying to achieve.
* Is it a request for more optimizations? Technically not out of scope, but we have already enough ideas and not enough time for those. Contributions welcome!

Thank you for your understanding!
