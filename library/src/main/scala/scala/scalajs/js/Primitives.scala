/** Supertype of all JavaScript values.
 *
 *  Subtypes of [[Any js.Any]] are facade types to APIs implemented in
 *  JavaScript code. Their implementation is irrelevant and never emitted.
 *  As such, all members must be defined with their right-hand-side being
 *  [[native js.native]].
 *
 *  In most cases, you should extend [[Object js.Object]] instead of this
 *  trait to define facade types.
 *
 *  It is not possible to define traits or classes that inherit both from this
 *  trait and a strict subtype of [[AnyRef]]. In fact, you should think of
 *  [[Any js.Any]] as a third direct subclass of [[scala.Any]], besides
 *  [[scala.AnyRef]] and [[scala.AnyVal]].
 *
 *  See the [[http://www.scala-js.org/doc/js-interoperability.html JavaScript
 *  interoperability guide]] of Scala.js for more details.
